#Freely - A Chatapp built on Web3
### Video Demo: TODO
### Description:

Welcome to Freely - a Web3 application that enables decentralization in a simple chat app! The webapp was written in Python (Flask), Javascript, HTML and CSS.

Features:
- Fully decentralized: With the use of SocketIO, you can still chat asynchronously without sacrificing privacy. The chat app was hosted serverless so no one can read your messages!
- Metamask authetication: Simply connect your wallet that holds our Edition-drop NFT and enter your username of choice, you are in!
- NFT integration: I strongly believe that NFTs are more than apes and PNGs, they are the future of identity and validation! 
- Modern design: I leverage the use of Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/
- Animation: With two simple library (animate css and animate on scroll), the website appears more lively and user-friendly.
